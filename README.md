## 1. Manufacturing Process

**1.1 Prepare Workspace**
- Clear your workspace for a clutter-free environment.
- Cover work surfaces with protective sheeting.
- Ensure good ventilation in the area.

**1.2 Prepare Container**
- Wash and dry container thoroughly.
- Secure the wick to the base using hot wax or adhesive, ensuring it's centered.

**1.3 Melt Wax**
- Melt soy wax flakes in a double boiler, stirring occasionally.
- Heat wax to 170-180°F (76-82°C), using a thermometer to monitor.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never leave melting wax unattended to prevent fire hazards. 

**1.4 Install Wick**
- Center the wick using a centering tool or a makeshift guide (e.g., pencil or chopstick).

**1.5 Pour Wax**
- After adding dye and fragrance at 140°F (60°C), pour the wax into the container, leaving space at the top.

> [!WARNING]
> Pour wax slowly to avoid spills and ensure the wick remains centered. 

**1.6 Finalize Candle**
- Let the candle cool undisturbed for 24 hours.
- Trim the wick to about ¼ inch for an even burn.

> [!WARNING]
> Use heat-resistant containers to prevent cracking.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Sinkholes**
  - **Issue:** Sinkholes appear in the wax near the wick or at the candle's surface as it cools.
  - **Solution:** Gently reheat the surface of the candle with a heat gun or place it in a warm oven to melt the top layer. Alternatively, pour a second layer of slightly cooler wax over the first to fill in any gaps.

- **Wick Burning Too Quickly or Slowly**
  - **Issue:** The wick burns too fast, resulting in a short candle life, or too slowly, causing an inadequate melt pool.
  - **Solution:** Ensure you're using the correct wick size for your candle's diameter. Thicker wicks are needed for wider candles, and thinner wicks are suitable for smaller candles. Adjust wick size accordingly in future batches.

- **Poor Scent Throw**
  - **Issue:** The candle does not emit much fragrance when lit.
  - **Solution:** Increase the fragrance oil ratio slightly within the manufacturer's recommended limits. Ensure the wax is not too hot when adding fragrance oils, as high temperatures can cause the fragrance to evaporate.

- **Uneven Surface**
  - **Issue:** The surface of the candle is rough or has imperfections after setting.
  - **Solution:** Ensure the wax is poured at the correct temperature. For a smooth surface, pour wax at a slightly cooler temperature. Use a heat gun to gently reheat the surface, allowing it to re-solidify smoothly.

- **Wick Has Drowned**
  - **Issue:** The wick is too short, becoming submerged in the wax as the candle burns.
  - **Solution:** Trim the wick to about ¼ inch above the wax surface before the initial burn. For future batches, ensure the wick is securely attached and stands upright, or consider using a longer wick.

### Quality Control Measures

- **Consistent Measurements:** Always measure fragrance oils and dye by weight rather than volume for consistency.
- **Test Burns:** Conduct test burns with new candle batches to ensure proper burn quality, including the melt pool's size and how evenly the candle burns.
- **Visual Checks:** Regularly inspect the color, consistency, and surface of candles for any signs of issues like frosting or separation, which could indicate improper mixing or temperature control.
